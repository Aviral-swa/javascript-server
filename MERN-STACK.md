**MERN** stack is a javascript stack or group of technologies which are used to create faster and reliable full stack web applications. MERN stack consists of 4 technologies namely: 
* MongoDB
* Express
* React
* Node.js
Each of these technologies play big part in deployment of web applications.

1.**MongoDB**

    MongoDB is a cross platform document oriented database in which data is saved in a document which consists of key value pairs. It is a NoSql database. MongoDB is used to create Schemas, Tables, databases Etc. Documents that uses and can be found using primary keys makes the basic unit of MongoDB

    Advantages of MongoDB: 

        Fast: because it is a document oriented database it is easy to index and has faster response time.

        Use of javascript: MongoDB uses javascript which is the biggest advantage.
    
        Simple Setup: It is very easy to use and setup MongoDB.

2.**Express**

    Express is a back-end Node.js Framework Which helps in designing great web applications and APIs. Instead of writing code in node and creating different modules Express makes it simpler to write and manage the back-end code. Express also support many middlewares which can be used to make the code even shorter and easier to read.

    Advantages of Express:

        Asynchronous and Single-threaded.

        Effecient, fast & scalable

        Has the biggest community for Node.js

3.**React**

    React  is a front-end javascript library used to create interactive UIs. React is mainly used to create single page applications and mobile applications because of its ability to react to rapidly changing data(hence the name React). In react we can code in javascript to create UI Components.

    Advantages of React:
        Virtual DOM – A virtual DOM object is a representation of a DOM object. Virtual DOM is actually a copy of the original DOM.
    
        JSX – Stands for JavaScript XML. It is an HTML/XML JavaScript Extension which is used in React.

        Components – ReactJS supports Components. Components are the building blocks of UI wherein each component has a logic and contributes to the overall UI.

4.**Node.js**
    
    Node.js provides a JavaScript Environment which allows the user to run their code on the server (outside the browser).

    Advantages of Node.js:
        Open source 

        Single threading

        Fast – Built on Google Chrome’s JavaScript Engine, Node.js has a fast code execution.
